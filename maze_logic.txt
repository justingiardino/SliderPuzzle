recursion call with current v and h search points

  while you haven't found the exit
    set move found equal to false
    check down
      if the space is empty and hasn't been visited
        move found equal true
        mark space as visited by adding to dictionary
        call recursion location below
      elif exit found
        move found true
        game over true
    check up
      if space below is empty and hasn't been visited
        move found equal True
        mark space as visited by adding to dictionary
        call recursion function on location above
      elif exit found
        move found true
        game over true
    check right
      if space to the right is empty and hasn't been visited
        move found equal True
        mark space as visited by adding to dictionary
        call recursion function on location to the right
      elif exit found
        move found True
        game over True
    check left
      if space to the left is empty and hasn't been visited
        move found True
        mark space as visited by adding to dictionary
        call recursion function on location to the right
      elif exit found
        move found True
        game over True
    after all checks, if move not found
      mark as bad space to not be visited again
      return to go back to previous coordinates to check for another direction
